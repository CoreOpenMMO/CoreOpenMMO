"human"              -> "No offence, but your race is weak. You lack both the physical strength and the true warrior spirit. And worst of all, you have no strategic thinking."

"scarab"             -> "Impressive animals. I have this idea of training them as battle steeds. Imagine this: Djinns mounted on scarabs! With a battalion of those I would crush the enemy in the blink of an eye!"

"pharaoh"            -> "Ankrahmun's pharaoh apparently believes himself to be some sort of god. Ah well. A solid blow with my scimitar will bring him back to earth soon enough!"
"palace"             -> "I suppose the palace is where the pharaoh resides. I have a distinct feeling I shall see it burn rather soon." 
"ascension"          -> "Apparently, ascension is what the followers of the pharaoh are after. No idea what exactly that is, though."

"uthun"              -> *
"akh"				         -> *

"kha'zeel"           -> "It was an excellent idea to build our headquarter in the mountains of kha'zeel. Easy to defend, you know. Too bad the enemy had the same idea."
"kha'labal"          -> "Kha'labal? Yes, it was me who devastated it. Couldn't leave it to the enemy, you see? We had to destroy it in order to save it!"
"war"                -> "War is the father of things, and I live and breathe it. Ok, it's a tad bit silly that we are forced to fight against our own kind, but as a good soldier I will do my duty! <salutes> ...",
                        "And if I hear anybody talking about 'peace' he will be court-martialled and summarily executed! Or vice versa!"
"melchior"           -> "Melchior! I remember that greedy little civilian. I would have court-martialled him, but I suppose it is just as well the way it is."
"alesar"             -> "Ah yes, Alesar! Excellent smith, that man!"
"fa'hradin"          -> "He is Gabel's lieutenant and confidant. He is a powerful wizard, one has to admit that - and that's the only reason he is still alive. Without all his magical mumbo jumbo we would have long since won this war."
"lamp"               -> "We sleep in those lamps. I like them - they are small and functional. We do not need cozy beds and fluffy duvets like decadent humans."

These supplies are crucial for us to win the war.","Unfortunately, it has happened that some of our supplies have disappeared on their way to this fortress. At first we thought it was the Marid, but intelligence reports suggest a different explanation. We now believe that a group of humans was behind the theft.","Unfortunately, we do not have much further specific information. All we know is that the thieves' hideout is somewhere in a northern city. However, you are a human, so you might stand a good chance to find those thieving jerks. I want them punished.

Something very special.","Listen: We have sent a spy Ashta'Daramai, our enemy's fortress. He was on a mission to steal certain documents for us. Unfortunately, we have lost contact with him.","We must find out what happened to him and, more importantly, to the documents. Go to the to the fortress and try to find him. Above all, find the documents and bring them to me.","A word of advice: Our spy entered the fortress through a network of underground tunnels. Perhaps you should sneak into Ashta'Daramai using the same route. That way he should be easy to find.","Go now and don't come back without the documents.", SetQuestValue (###,###)

Tell you what, soldier - I will order that stubborn Alesar to fully cooperate with you. He's got some pretty nice items to sell. He won't like it, of course, but I'm sure he will do as he is told. He is a namby-pamby civilian after all.","Oh, and ask him about a mission, too. I think he and Malor were talking about a plan.", SetQuestValue(###,###)

"uthun"             -> "The Uthun is the part of the trinity that is easiest to form. It consists of our recollections of the past and of our thoughts. It is that which determines who we are in this world and it gives us guidance throughout our existence."
"mourn"             -> "The dead mourn the living because they are weak and excluded from ascension."
"arena"        -> "The arena is a suitable distraction for the Uthun of the mortals. It might even serve as a place for them to prove their worth. If they pass the test they may be freed of their mortal shells."

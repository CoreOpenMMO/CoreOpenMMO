"name"     -> "My name is Gail, nice to meet you."
"time"     -> "I am sorry but watches are not that common here. Time has little meaning in this quite boring colony."
"king"     -> "The Thaian monarch entrusted Venore with much responsibility to manage this colony. Sadly he did not entrust the entire control in our hands which is a constant reason for all kinds of problems."
"venore"   -> "Venore is a beautiful city and its community is built up on commerce. Therefore it serves the needs of everyone who wants to contribute his share to the welfare of the city."
"thais"    -> "A somewhat chaotic town. I understand how its growth dictated the shape of its community but I also see the flaws in the outcome."
"carlin"   -> "Their independence is just insane viewed from an economic angle. A complete waste of resources."
"edron"    -> "Another area that could and should prosper under Venoran guidance. If the king sees how we handle this settlement, he will for sure be impressed enough to allow us more freedom on that promising isle."

"ankrahmun"   -> "Well, I admit I fail to see any profit that could safely be made by trading with that city, but even unsafe profit is a good one. Prices have to be adjusted accordingly to the course." 
"ferumbras"   -> "One evil sorcerer, no matter how powerful he might be, can have only a certain influence on the market. There are other threats to our profit that are more urgent."
"excalibug"   -> "A knight's fairy tale."
"apes"       -> "Those animals are one of the worst things we have to face here."
"lizard"    -> "There must be some way to leverage their hatred towards those apes."
"dworcs"     -> "Luckily, this horrible ugly things stay in their own territory but who knows for how long? We should never show them any sign of weakness."

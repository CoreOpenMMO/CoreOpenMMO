"name"     -> "My name is Adall but everyone is calling me old Adall."
"time"     -> "Hehe, old men have no need for watches. Watches are mocking you, you know?"

"watch"    -> *
"king"     -> "I saw the king and even his father. Thais used the be my home port in the old times."
"venore"   -> "Those newcomers have quite an attitude and it is growing worse with the years. Ambition, ambition. It's all about ambition."
"thais"    -> "It used to be a lovely town but over the years it has become crowded and noisy."
"carlin"   -> "Hehe, it's not such a bad town for a visit, as long as you have your own alcohol on board and are not catched drunk in the city. I had to learn it the hard way and was arrested twice in my youth."
"edron"    -> "Edron is not the lovely little isle people tend to think it is. There are secrets and ancient evil beneath the ground. Things that had better been left burried, have been unearthed."
"jungle"   -> "The challenge the jungle is providing is something for the young and daring. I am not going to leave the security of the town, I'll just stay here and watch how things turn out."

"darama"      -> "One might think it's a strange place for an old man to settle down but I never had a child and I like to see this settlement grow and come of age in my last days ."
"darashia"    -> "The people of Darashia are friendly. Still there is nothing exciting that would justify a voyage there."
"ankrahmun"   -> "That city has given me the creeps for as long as I have known about it. Whenever we sailed there, I had a bad feeling of impending doom." 
"ferumbras"   -> "I wonder if he's the Thaian version of the boogey man."
"boogey","man" -> "The boogey man is only a myth to scare the children and keep them away from the jungle."
"excalibug"   -> "I heard about that weapon in each and every harbour I have visited. Never heard more than rumours though."
"apes"        -> "The apes are for Port Hope what the the orcs are for Thais."
"lizard"     -> "I think they are suspicious and just because they are far away does not mean they are nice neighbours."

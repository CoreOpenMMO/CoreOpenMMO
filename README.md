# Sharp OTServer

## What is Sharp OTServer?
Sharp OTServer is a project that focus on porting, to C#, the codes from [The Forgotten Server](https://github.com/otland/forgottenserver) and [OTX](https://github.com/mattyx14/otxserver) (that are, currently, the most updated OT servers).

We'll soon have more to show you guys and also more info to display here. So, stick with us during our development!
